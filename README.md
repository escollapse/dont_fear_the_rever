# don't fear the rever(se engineering challenges)

just practice!

compile the challenge and run the binary:

**gcc** **-o** **chal0** **chal0.c**

**./chal0**

* what do you see in the output?
* is that _all_ the output?
* (first try without looking at it, but) what is happening in the source code?
